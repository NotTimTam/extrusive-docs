# Features

**extrusive.md** is and always will be **100% free and open-source**.

The CLI is a **simple interface** that requires almost no set-up work.

**extrusive.md** compiles your documentation with a **mobile-first design** model that took inspiration from other <a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">modern documentation websites</a>.

## Custom styles and scripts

**extrusive.md** has built-in support for unlimited custom CSS and JavaScript files, allowing you to modify its design and extend its functionality.

## Dark mode

Device-theme detecting light/dark mode and a manual toggle between the themes is easily accessible by users.

## Beautiful icons and HTML

**extrusive.md** has O.O.T.B. support for <a href="https://ionic.io/ionicons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ion-icons</a>, a massive, open-source icon library.

You can include as much custom HTML, directly in your markdown, as you want! (this site is full of it)

## PDFs and printing

A quick button and keyboard shortcuts allow users to instantly print your documentation with the same beautiful styling they see on the page.

## Self-deployement in seconds

**extrusive.md** can be deployed as an <a href="https://expressjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">express</a> server, or a static site.

With just one command, the CLI will compile a fully functional app for you in seconds!

## Internal linking

To create a _regular_ link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., `[example text]`) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., (`https://www.example.com`)).

```markdown
My favorite example domain is [example.com](https://example.com).
```

To link to another page within your documentation, simply add an `!` before the relative path to the document. **Make sure to include `%20` instead of spaces in any paths you create!**

```markdown
Check out my other article: [other-article](!/content/Other%20Folder/Other%20File.html)
```

Including `/content` at the start of the path, and `.html` at the end works best, but links will work without them. (e.g., `(!/Other%20Folder/Other%20File)`)

## Code highlighting

<a href="https://highlightjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highlight.js</a> automatically highlights your code, making it pretty and easier to read!

## Document searching

**extrusive.md** comes packed with a built-in powerful search bar that remembers user's searches.

The compiler auto-indexes your documentation and builds search results for you, so that you can focus on content.
